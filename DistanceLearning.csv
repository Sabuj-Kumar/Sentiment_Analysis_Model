Love hearing from fellow students about transitioning to online learning. We're all in this together!
"Transitioning to online learning was definitely tough, but I am really growing to like it."
"Online learning certainly isn’t the best, but it does have a lot of benefits. Thanks for the video!"
For me offline class is more in learning than online class.
Offline classes are always best
"Blaming e-learning when the real problem that he is trying to explain is the inability of teachers to ""storytell"" in the way they teach."
"As long as people want money, nothing will change, schools will remain as dull human generators"
Watched a video from Carl sagan and he spoke of how young children enter school full of wonder and questions and graduate with these qualities gone. Something seriously wrong with our school system
online learning isnt just killing education. its killing us students too...
"Honestly a lot of teachers/professors still teach us even through virtual class by telling stories, examples of their or other's experience.etc. May God Bless them ❤️."
I had a great chemistry teacher who would open his lectures up with stories and history around what we were going to learn in chemistry! It made me so excited to then learn all of the formulas etc. I was doing something that others before me had to figure out and apply to the real world. I had a math teacher who did the same. These are two subjects we don’t usually think of as an opportunity for that. If you take out time from the lesson to give it historical context (I do this with my music students all the time) you will have the most passionate and interested students. They’ll never forget what they learned !
"A lot of people seem to be pointing out the fact that the title is misleading, and that it isn't about online learning in particular. Yes, they're right, but I think the inefficiency is more pronounced in online classes, perhaps that's what the speaker was trying to say? Anyhow, the points were all very valid. Education needs a big change."
Not just elearning education in general have that problem. That's why teachers still matter. We can't tell stories if we are expected to follow and plan minutes by minutes prescription of content dumping.
"not click and quiz, but stories and meaning --- scenario and story based learning best way "
"We are in middle of time to analyse the results of e-learning industry. I am working on both modes, but I feel that human interaction has its own charm."
only if the school system understood
Well not all e-learning is the same it’s very dependent on other things like teachers and subject.
I got a 0 on 2 tests because the online learning website didn’t work for me for 2 days.
"I have seen roll play scenarios in computer based training. Some of it is truly cringeworthy. In interactions with fraud, body language can play a large part. A bit of proper exaggeration may be good in initial training. However as you advance and need to spot more subtle body language, you need much better actors to model that. It really is a combination of how well the material is done and how much the student desires to know it."
"Trust me, I work in tech. I have sat through 30 minute youtube tutorials to find 5 seconds of content that I needed to see to show a missing detail in some complex process. Even if the video is as boring as sin. You have to watch it like a hawk on the off chance you can pick op a detail or two that will help you with your problem."
"That is very targeted learning. There is a big difference between someone like me, who may have a server keep going offline for no apparent reason and I have to resolve the problem and the average Joe watching a mandatory safety video. No matter how bad the video is, I have look for anything that might help me do my job. I am invested in self improvement. The average Joe who is being paid to take off half an afternoon from work to watch a well done video and then take a multiple choice quiz and can take it multiple times till they get it right. Well they are not nearly as focused. I know I am not when watching those training videos. They are a distraction, not part of the main domain of the work I do."
"Results are going to vary. Even a poor video and be a big help, and a well done video can be practically worthless."
Im so happy with how my college is doing with the distance learning (personally) there not doing mandatory zoom meetings and they even record them for ppl who couldn’t attend because of whatever reason
"People forget because what they get at school every day is a bunch of no experiences. No wonder that those who hardly had any contact with the education system frequently do better than people with PHDs, they have experienced and hence learnt more."
"A lot of people seem to be pointing out the fact that the title is misleading, and that it isn't about online learning in particular. Yes, they're right, but I think the inefficiency is more pronounced in online classes, perhaps that's what the speaker was trying to say? Anyhow, the points were all very valid. Education needs a big change."
"The failure of eLearning does not come for the creators but from the stakeholders; the one's who are paying the bill. As ID people we have not forgotten about our targeted audience's, but have been forced to sweep them under the rug at the cost of the learner. Aaron Barth, you are preaching something that is well know by the Learning and Development group."
"E learning is the tip of the iceberg.
Virtual reality is going to change society beyond recognition"
My son has always been a straight  A student and is struggling and im feeling a bit hopeless
Left-wing university education leads to disaster. E-learning is good. Everyone can choose.
What about nowadays where e-learning is the only choice we have amidst the Covid-19 pandemic? What would Dr. Barth suggest for teachers?
"e-learning was designed to kill education by the corporations interested in turning education into a for profit for business, they will never understand the value of education. As a lecturer I find  most of the interesting conversations occur that have not been planned for the lecture when people have a voice to tell their own experience, it will return back........eventually."
School itself is not educating
"You can learn something in two ways or by remembering the words or by using your imagination 
There are so few teachers good at that"
online school is stressful
"this ted talk and youtube is kind of like e-learning platform lol. And most of us enjoy it, and make up something after something."
This hits different during covid times
If a child bound to do  mistakes while learning something new then why do teachers criticize students for their mistakes .'
Nonsense. This guy has a really limited experience of the world and clearly hasn't talked to the students. Even if he has been a teacher. There's so much that people are learning through elearning.
The reason we don’t do this in eLearning is because it’s three time more difficult and takes four times as long to do
"education no matter where you get it, the real problem is what you make of it"""
Covid regulations have forced this too..
"Very Impressive. I think, if online learning on going as representation of post-humanism there education will end."
I wish school was back in the damn school already because I’m sick of online class
The lecture is only a small part of learning! E-learning in any form is also only a small part of learning! The REAL learning happens in the head of the student/pupil only when the student/pupil WANTS to learn and works to learn. This happens outside of the classroom at home where the student/pupil reads the coursebooks and looks up information not found in the coursebooks and makes note in writing by hand! Writing by longhand has been proven by brain research to be more effective for the retention of what has been written than writing by tapping at the keys of a computer.  And thinks about what he/she has read! The lecture is only a support and an opportunity to discuss the topic with the lecturer and ask clarifying questions about something found in the books. 
"most governments are cutting fundings for education which results in rise in number of adhoc(kind of temporary) teaching positions while the administrative positions are permanent. For example, compare the pay gap between an administrator and a teacher at a college/school. Hence the process of recruitment is affected and sometimes quality of teachers is compromised."
Online learning seemed to b a good thing before lockdown but now everyone knows how ineffecient and boring it is 
I think the problem is the privatisation of education and it's more seen as a money spinner these days rather than concentrating on educating people.
School is a test of memorizing not a test of knowledge
E-Learning is the future.  Make sure you learn the technology skill and teach online.
"Well, better to have e-learning rather to no learning at all, don't you think?"
"The whole problem about elearning is that it's virtual and it lacks interaction with people, which we all are used to, for summarizing."
"I imagine online learning to have too much text, videos and not enough interaction. I haven't done much online learning but usually find udemy courses somewhat boring because of this."
"When i was at a normal school, I get good grades now look at this. I get 0 on some works even though I did the work."
When internet classes started it began the beginning of killing educational tradition
I like physical school instead of online school because when I have problems no friend to talk too
"E-learning is not killing education, what is killing education are those preposterous prices that universities charge, at least in the US."
Did this philosoph ever write 1 single line of code of a learning program?
Isn’t it proven that in school learning is equal or worse to E-learning?
"Some good points. Hence, I really have not finished an online course ever unless it is highly experiential."
"Learning style and content just like public speaking style and content needs to be delivered with the audience in mind. Also, focus on residual knowledge not just quantity knowledge. Exercises, projects, time for self-reflection about the material are very important also for learning."
School already has a out-aged dead education that never provides anyone’s needs online school or in reality school will never change
"Some Teachers and lecturers don't do entry behaviour,  don't relate the purpose of what is being taught to how relevant it is and or its implementation.."
"How are using real examples and e-learning in conflict?? I mean, it's essential to connect theory to practice but it has nothing to do with e-learning"
"I am going to say this was with most respect, the story telling is done by the Chinese to effect human ethics on education and it's better than e-education"
Can’t believe this was a month before the pandemic
I thought online classes was the future.
"The other problem that e-learning causes is comfortable behavior in children. Because children are at home, they do not take their education seriously and fail due to relaxed behavior. They opted to play and goof off instead of concentrating on their classes. My 6 year old is going through this right now in first grade."
"I work an 8-5 shift remotely while obtaining my masters in Data Science online. I actually like having the opportunity to work remotely and learn online. The benefits to me is that I do not have to physically be in a classroom and can move around. If I want to travel to a beautiful city while working and studying I can do so. To me this has been very beneficial and I have saved tons of money (commuting, clothes, food at work) that I was able to reinvest in the stock market."
"I'm an e-Learning developer and my approach to it is to tell a story. The problem I find resides with the clients that just want to pour their PowerPoint contents into a e-Learning format and don't care if there's a better way to do it. Things are changing though, some are listening to what we advise."
The real problem is the modern college system hasn’t caught up with the times. They keep raising prices and curtailing flexibility to meet the teacher’s needs when they want to teach not when the students want to learn. At the end of the day people want cheaper prices and flexibility.
"In fact, if the teachers are giving full commitment, the student are enthusiast to learn, and the management system of the school is excellent, the school can be the place where we can develop our skills and abilities. Not e-learning 🤔"
Everyone keeps saying this is title is misleading and I agree but what I think they mean is teaching without storytelling is just like e-learning no interactions between student and the educator
It all starts with the “modern“ school 😕
E-learning is the future of education and needs to be. It’s the only way to achieve productivity gains so teachers can make reasonable salaries. Of course this implies that the subject matter is appropriate (math and science work well...) and that the instruction is well designed (different learning types and cultures are handled...). And once the bulk of academic courses are converted we can (finally!) begin to focus on the all important soft skills in the classroom.
"I think the title was not properly explaining the talks. Aaron talkes about the content or method for teaching, not the tools (e-learning itself)."
There are some things that are learned much Better online
"So it is true that Academia in Canada is filled with SJWs. Really misleading title and topic. The problem has nothing to do with e-learning and he undervalued its results. The problem is an educators inability of telling stories but also bad teaching in general perpetuated by bureaucracy, underfunding, and overlapping non-related issues in the world with actual issues causing problems."
"E- ""LEARNING"" DOES NOT EXIST!
Dear sir, learning is always a local, psychic process, which takes place in person and cannot take place at a distance. Distance learning can be held, so the real term is E-TEACHING."
Digital learning makes my brain commit suicide
"E-learning is killing educators, students, and learning itself. People are human, not E-human."
"Sick of bad teachers with handouts and overheads. Come on, information is better communicated via new media.
Teachers Salary take 80% of Education Budgets."
"I thInk , blad man is loosing some money due to e-learning"
"I prefer Unschooling... My educational journey was a waste of time and money.  I didn't learn real history, nothing about money or starting a business, learned that a Virus isn't contagious and not a disease... so, our gov is lying about CV19? I think conventional education dumbs us down."
"I agree with the reference to elearning being able to educate people to sustain the planet and avoid climate change. I'm a Digital Learning Manager and I'm about to design a MOOC on this very topic. A Massively Open Online Course specifically address some of the issues around planetary and environmental consciousness. This is a good talk although I don't agree obviously. I've seen plenty of online/digital learning which is really engaging, innovative and including lots of great interactive media."
"when you use a computer, your files are organised, also people can still use textbooks in e-learning"
E=learning makes indoctrination harder...I mean education.
"School and class room teaching has a lot of constraints. It is produced live with very little reality surrounding them to teach practical stuff.  A video liberates the teacher. They can bring actual circumstances and contexts. Time and distance can be shrunk. 
Long ago I was evaluating various e-learning platforms. One was on welding. It talked of 10 methods. Illustrations used were from text books. At least half the methods were uncommon and most people may not have seen. These were also taught with illustrations from the book and narrative. I felt these should be like documentaries. They should have gone to real environments where such welding is done and shot the process with the actual equipment and let the operators to explain what the process is about. I fully appreciate your criticism of chalk and board style teaching on line."
online class is better what about those are cheating and have poor connectivity
Online education is far better than offline education.Online edu is affordable price.Not waste of time and money in traveling 
"The problem with online education, at least in Costa Rica, is that not all the people have access to a decent internet connection, not because it is not available but because some families don´t have money to pay for it. This is creating a big gap between social classes, where families with a better economical situation are continuing with a virtual learning process, but on the other side, some families are struggling to survive one day at a time, specially now with all the COVID 19 issues, this is seriously affecting the education process in many countries in our region, if we are moving forward to this new online education era, the governments need to invest first on decent and affordable  connectivity services first to look for some equity among the population."
"Now that we're in the era of on-line education post covid, does that mean Phoenix University is the Harvard of on-line schools; seeing as how Harvard is the oldest university?"
E learning is nt effective atleast runing our beautiful and bright future
"There is a lot of interaction online. I chat with students, do Discussion Boards with students, email students, video chat with students, video chat with groups of students, and I even make personalized youtube videos to help students with specific problems. Also, all of my students respond in a discussion, not just the student who speaks up. Online, EVERY student discusses every topic, and EVERY student can get personalized help if needed. "
"I believe all he is really talking about is an online learning system that ""accommodates"" to the student. Those are already rolling. They are far from perfect, but they exist."
We have different type of people we cannot afford online education we don't have proper resources for everyone... Bss  can afford that but we have to think about those who don't have Internet facilities our rural areas 
"Infact online education is cheaper and stronger than offline education.  Yes, it cannot replace offline education.  Still, during these times, Government must make online education free and compulsory for all students."
" Since 21feb, when first case of codiv-19 happened in my little town of Codogno, I attended to these online courses and they helped me very much to manage work, my families and give good suggestion to my friend. Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove is one of the few scientists able to translate complex topics into simple and full understandable ones.  It is even rarer to meet these high skills and abilities in such a graceful lady, with a clear and pleasant voice like the rustle of leaves in spring and at the same time a strong, confident, sweet but decisive look.."
I wish to join online courses. How can I access to such course?
We are unable to see our own parents and family because of this pandemic. When we can get the vaccine to fight this pandemic. How long we can stay at home. It's almost six months but  only trainings 😥😥😥. We need medicine to save our brothers and sisters all over the world.
As a medical professional of 35 years I will never ever never take a course from The WHO!
I teach in a rural district and many of our families do not have internet. General education teachers are recording videos on flash drives which will be dropped off by the school bus to our families who don't have internet. The students who do have internet will download the videos from our website. Do you have any suggestions how a special education teacher can help students without internet who can only receive help through pre-recorded videos?
Shame  on USA instead spend money on defence instead of educative innovation for the next generation.
Majority of the students in the world can't afford the luxury of online education
I kept saying this for like 5 years now. The Education System we have is currently outdated and is not up to speed with the modern times. The Government should've upgraded the education system but no they never did.
"I'm teaching via a basic messaging app, voice, text and ebooks - no need for complicated platforms; 2G 3G 4G would suffice. Are schools over-complicating the requirements? Usually the teachers tools are a board and a book, a voice and a virtual stick...I've never known such attendance levels as I have now. Present information, question concepts, correct or congratulate = teaching."
"25 yrs ago the Georgia state department of education went headlong into distance learning. Unfortunately, funds were not consistently allocated. Now we still have major gaps in our poorer areas, as this pandemic has shown. Several schools have resorted to printing out lessons, which are delivered weekly to a neighborhood center along with school meals. Wifi is only available when the center is open, 2-4 hrs 3 days a week. Very few elementary students have access to any electronic device other than a parent's phone. How can we change this when all states are going to have to cut budgets sharply this yr? Must we continue to have such a sharp division in the availability of education? This is an issue that distance learning was designed to correct, or at least that is what I understood when I became involved with it. Is there a financially viable answer?"
"""Five years from now, we'll be beyond the medical crisis, beyond the economic crisis."" That seems very optimistic. The economic crisis caused by reactions to the cv might become another Great Depression. It could even lead to world war. It could lead to a new monetary system with much more authoritarian control over the lives of us common folk that could even become similar to a futuristic form of global technocratic slavery. Look at what the power brokers at the World Economic Forum are pushing with their ""The Great Reset"" idea."
"I work with adults in the evening and teenagers during the day, and the gap is huge. Most of the adult learners didn't even know what Zoom was, but are engaged throughout the lesson even after an entire day working. Some teens however, and it's not just one or two, are not even trying... The more devices they have at home, the less engaged with learning they are. I'm not worried about losing a school year or two. That's nothing compared to the fact that they don't understand the importance of learning. No matter how much time I put into creating engaging resources, some kids just don't care and the gap becomes bigger and bigger. What will happen to those kids? Will we go back in time? I must confess that I fear the impact of remote learning as much as I admire its potential!"
Okay i hope that next year that remote learning ends
"College age kids want to meet physically and interact.  From a social standpoint, remote learning will fail because college kids want to leave mommy and daddy and GO TO COLLEGE"
"Remote learning?  Oh you mean home schooled with an extra step. We'll just home school then. Looks like teachers are proving there not ""essential"""
Yes.  For  digital education only we require only  50 % current infra . Ofcourse for certain core courses we require  labs and campus facilities  and again  the cost of university education will reduce to 50 % since students do not use any infra ..  lets embrace new way of education
"I miss normal school.. This online school for me personally has been AWFUL! I have never been so stressed out in my life for school. It's difficult to pay attention, staring at a computer screen.. No matter what I do... Hurts my eyes and I have more headaches than ever. I have the worst Wi-Fi connection and have missed so much school, notes, and so much more and I am having the worst time trying to keep up. It's my senior year and I feel like I'm not gonna graduate because of this.. I'm exhausted all the time, can hardly understand the teachers and have had so many panic attacks and anxiety attacks, that are making things worse no matter what I do, and it ruins my want to even do school... I love school but with all this online school.. I honestly just feel like I don't even want to do anything anymore and it makes me so upset and just drained."
I am doing online work now and I am not used to it. It’s kinda hard to do my work and certain assignments are due at the same times 😤😫
"It’s 2021! The fact that there are so many American children who don’t have computers at home is crazy! Technology and access to the internet are essential. Even when schools are open, children should have the ability to learn and find resources that are available for free on the internet such as Khan Academy and edX."
"I graduate in 2021, I'm just wondering how I'm supposed to get my 60 credits when I'm going to have 3 electives and 3 regular classes"
"I taught for 34 years.  I am skeptical that on-line learning is the answer.  I struggled to get students to bring a pencil to class. Until I bought gross of golf pencils, but that didn't prevent them from writing on the desks instead of completing the lesson. And the students today are expected to substitute hours to make up for their absence in front of a licensed, educated teacher for something on their computer, notebook or phone -  good lick with that, suckers"
"Very Impressive. I think, if online learning on going as representation of post-humanism there education will end."
What about the parents that work bills still have to be paid
I don't want online school 😭😩
Parents can tutor online learning.
"So a pandemic is what it takes for families to go on line schools , and children already online have more problems with teachers , counselor.  not up dating material fast enough for the handful right now ......good luck ..... no children in schools no teachers to pay the is the district way"
"Online learning, virtual learning is a disaster."
"Well... I will say that having children to stay at home and learn has helped to increase parental involvement in their child's education! It has also helped to reduce the amount of disruptions that interfere with student learning in the classroom setting.I actually have some students who are doing their class work now that they are home!!  It is not up to the schools to babysit and parent  your child...  In fact, I would make more money babysitting instead of teaching!!!!"
I hate online schooling. Not just because we have to do so much but also because the electives. Those thing's just make me so stress not just having to learn these thing's by my self pretty much i still have to do electives its just not a fun time for kid's.
Online is the way of the future
Ah... I remember when I used to make good grades
At this point I wanna die from Covid than to fail and not graduate..
"I cannot do this anymore. This is painful. If we were in school physically, not many of us would be failing classes. We should either be in school or stay home and not do anything. If we were to switch to distance learning, we should do pass or no mark."
"I thought school would be easier like this, now it’s the other way round"
"I rather run away than go and do my 168 missing assignments , I literally can’t do one because I’m so depressed"
"Before online school: Good student, As and Bs Online School: Fs and Ds, stress, and absolutely no motivation"
I feel like a failure. This is only making me more depressed. And I’m in college :(
The teachers looking at these comments like “hmmm seems like more homework would fix the issue”
In my opinion they should stop all schooling until it is safe for us to go back in person
I feel like I'm traumatized of school now. Everytime I get a message from my teacher I just completely go mess mode??
"This is so trueeee. Literally my whole life and im not exaggerating I got straight A's for 10 years straight in a row FOR EACH QUARTER I HAD ALL A'S MY WHOLE LIFE. As soon as online school started, I started getting A,B, D, and F's and they threatened to take me out advance classes if i continue to get an F. Online school IS NOT IT! I constantly get GROUNDED ever since online school started because of my grades. I think it also has to due with me being in a toxic environment"
They need to just wrap everything up and call it a year what’s the point if no one‘s learning anything I used to do well in school now I am failing
school is like a 300 meter thick wall that you have to get through but all you have is a plastic spoon from costco
I was worried that i'm the only one cheating and litterly using brainly 24/7 because its litterly impossible without a teacher and makes no sense.
I can't take this online school stuff any longer. my teachers are slow brained and they put in assignments that aren't even due yet.
I wish I never took school for granted because now I miss it
Online school has screwed my life over.
It’s hard to running online class. We’re unmotivated and I just can’t do it anymore
Online school definitely isn’t working BUT I think we should just put school on pause for now
"I cant do this anymore. this online class stuff I cant handle. I'm literally about to kill myself over this. It's already bad enough I have depression and anxiety."
"I used to be an AB student and the lowest I would get was a C, Now I have a D- in Math thanks to COVID and to make things worse, Teachers be giving me like 20 assignments a week"
"I’m going to say it, schooling should really be paused until it’s safe for in-person learning for those who actually benefit more from it than just staring at a computer screen which can also do some eye damage since it’s all we ever work on for remote classes."
I've learned more just reading these comments than actually in online school.
"Man i am going through it. 
I never was a perfect student, 
But I have never had grades this low before. 
I went from having C's B's and A's
To barely having a 50 in 2 classes.
I can't take this anymore. This has ruined my home life. I can't even do anything at home because my mom stays on my back all the time. I need comfort from yall, I'm a senior😞"
The fact im working all alone and teachers are putting lots of work doesn’t help either 
As i student i find it harder to engage through online when we were in person i was doing good however as we were online i counting to struggle
"My grades before covid: A, A, A-, B+, A-, A, B-. My grades now: F, F, C-, F, D+, F F. not even exaggerating"
"I'm In my junior year currently in high school, and ever since I started these online classes, I seen  a dramatic decrease in my academic performance and the grades reflect that.  I have a lot of at home priorities and people to take care of, which distracts me a lot from studies. I just want things to go back to normal man :/"
every time i think my brain just wants me to off myself. i’m failing and my parents hate me for it
"tell me how i went 9 years of school NEVER getting deficiencies, failing classes or getting grades lower than 80, now we're doing online school and i am struggling so hard. I am failing all of my 4 core classes which means ill probably have to retake them or get held back. we have shit going on at home bro, we have little siblings to look after and we are not made to learn in our bedrooms through a computer screen. i think school should be put on pause while we are social distancing or not make school mandatory or use our quarantine grades against us. i hate this so much I've never considered dropping out but now its something that i wish i could do."
I miss the time where I actually wanted to do home schooling. I will never want that again
Okay well I’m the only one who flunked this semester
Ahhh finals week and I’m probably gonna fail that too no credits for this semester 
Didn’t they say if you fail class online you can’t get held back or have summer school
"it's funny cause i didn't lose any intelligence, in fact in quarantine i have gained a lot of knowledge, from studying and learning things on my own. The Fs don't mean i'm less smart, it's a good representation of online school failing us."
MY TEACHER ALWAYS CALLS MY NAME IN THE GROUP CHAT AND MY MOTHER WOULD ALWAYS SEE IT 
WHENEVER I TRY EDUCATING MYSELF I STILL GET LOW GRADE
"I’m great at cheating, so I’m passing all my classes with ease, but once I get back to school, I’m failing my math class for sure lol"
Bless all the at home learners.. I’ve seen my child get failing grades for the first time and I’ve seen her academic motivation just drop. I feel sorry for this generation they’re learning near nothing.. for a month in a row all of my child’s school assignments were simple reading and simple multiplication. She’s not being challenged like she was when she was full time school. My kid got the short end of the straw in the beginning she only had school on Mondays and Wednesday’s the other 3 week days she was given at home assignments no online or zoom learning. So behavior wise she would just go to “get it over with not to learn” because after Wednesday she’s off for the other 3 school days and the weekend.. off 5 days before she goes back to school on Mondays. That’s just sad I see.. in America my child only gets 12 hours of education a week? and Now the school sent home all children for online learning permanently wth. This is all too terrible pushing for a private school or tutor.
"I just noticed online school only happened because of corona. I could’ve had good grades in irl school if it wasn’t for corona."
"I’m only 13 and I feel like ending it all. I’m behind in school, my parents are getting mad because I’m behind, my motivation and love for learning is gone and the government are failing us all!!! I’m ready to go."
"Don’t worry fellow students I don’t think their gonna fail us all cuz thousand of students are prolly failing because of online so I don’t think they’ll fail us"
"Got my first F ever in college this semester. I'm having a hard time accepting it mentally, but what can I do. A little sensitivity from my uni would be appreciated. Instead they chose to invest so much money into technologies that watch us take exams in our own private homes. We don't have access to so many resources we usually have on campus, yet they expect us to maintain ""integrity"" and not use notes. Not fair"
"They’re telling me i have to pass 3 classes or else i’ll fail the year"
"For me it's been hard to do online school. I'm not liking it at all because my assignment work is too heavy. I live in California and the covid cases are bad here."
"I also live in CA, I finally decided to take 2 AP classes my senior year and now I'm getting all Fs in all six of my classes. I'm in a position where I might not graduate because of math. I have no idea how to do any of the work and semester 1 grades are almost here. If I dont get ag least Ds I this semester I cant graduate"
"I hate making excuses for my failures but they can’t fail me this year. I just was not mentally there"
"I feel so disappointed in my self I feel like a failure I used to have really good grades and now I get low grades"
"I hate how it’s called failing. It’s not that I am “failing” it’s the fact that I didn’t get enough help and instruction to help me pass."
"Im glad to know im not alone in failing classes. Ive basically failed all my classes this year, and being put into summer school to make up those classes"
"I failed all of my exams this semester..... "
"I’m still struggling in my classes too"
I thought I was doing bad freshman year last year but now I’m literally failing everything
"It’s just the motivation just ain’t there to do anything, especially since I don’t have zoom classes, so it’s more of just having a ton of home work all in one day instead of an actual class."
"Teacher: Why the hell you're not attending our online classes!!??

Also me: ( Waiting for 31 minutes straight for teacher to accept my join meeting permission )"
"As a student, its hard to focus on the screen, and my grades... it got off the rails, like, im just commenting this, while crying and wanted the online school to end :(
"
As a senior in high school I have always had straight A’s but I feel that the schooling system has failed me to a point that one assignment or a WiFi mishap is all my fault and as punishment my grade drops drastically.
"When I was in grade school, I always had this mentality that I need to have exceptional grades in order to be successful in life. However, my academic performance said otherwise; I ended up flunking 8th grade and graduated high school in 2013 with barely a 2.0 GPA. (no AP classes taken). And obviously, I didn't go to college.....well not right away, and it wasn't a top-ranked school"
I'm glad to know that I am not the only one stressed out too. But I would have been better if I was in school than in a virtual school. I now have 37 missing assignments and it's hard to keep up with them. I can't take it anymore doing virtual school my eyes just hurt by looking at the screen for 8 hours straight. Especially when the teachers have light mode on.
Couldn't school just stop until the pandemic is over then continue? That could've been easier. I understand why teachers want us to turn on the camera but I don't feel comfortable looking at my own face or showing my face. 
"It's hard that my Asian parents won't let me be in peace. About almost anything, I do they'll tell the whole family. 
Every time I just can't stop stuttering. Sometimes my parents would get angry for stuttering in class. I just don't how to control my stuttering. I just don't feel fine anymore man..."
"I feel so unmotivated for school... I use to be a honor grade kid but now I’m a borderline/failing kid ;-; help... 😭😭😭"
"I just gotta say that 
If none of this online stuff or pandemic stuff happened
I wouldn’t been getting 90’s like on every subject 
So much stress is on me I can’t even catch up with about 8 assignments coming each day
I can never take a break"
"I searched this up just to see I wasn’t the only one who wasnt doing good in school"
"not everyone’s home life is easy to handle and having to learn from home doesn’t make it easier..."
"I literally just Google the answers but then I feel like a failure because of that"
"I knew I was gonna fail this year. Virtual has made me lose all motivation to do anything. I'm depressed and stressed out. And all my parents can say are ""This is easy work your suppose to be smart"". I can't anymore I'm just glad it's over"
"I used to have good grades till I got tempted to do gaming distracting me from school
"
"I literally used to be a student who would finish homework before school even ended
And I would get REALLY good grades
But now online school has ruined me, and I have 256 missing assignments
Not even the weekends are making me feel better"
"Literally my exact situation I’m a sophomore also AND I take honors class and I’m in a program. I have a chance of getting kicked out my program by the end of the year if I don’t get my grades up. It’s only the second quarter, but I’m afraid I’m not going to be able to get good grades throughout the year and would have to stay back. My mom is like I just need to focus, but I CANT I get so distracted so easily and have no motivation to even do an assignment. One week I would be so motivated then the next I would just space out in all of my zoom classes. I failed like 3 classes out of 8 last quarter, but right now I’m failing more than that. I don’t know what to do I don’t want to talk to my mom or any counselor because that’s not going to help me at all."
"I was literally #2 in my math class and got student of the month for three months before COVID and now I’m definitely about the fail 9th grade......someone come hit me with a bus"
"They expect way too much out of us in online school what may last over a month to teach in normal school they expect you to learn within a days (or 2) time so if you mess up twice you have to completely restart and taking notes is even harder due to having to do 7 different classes and with how long each lesson takes you don't get enough time to take all the notes needed unless that's all you wanna do for most of the day and don't even get me started on how much stress it induces at one point I was starting to taste a metallic coppery flavor in my mouth and my heart felt like it was on fire due to how stressful it all was and I'm going to have to repeat the grade all because my computer broke and the school isn't willing to supply one so I'm screwed and it's all because they couldn't wait a single year for all that's going on to calm down"
"Oh, yeah, I wonder why I'm failing, maybe because I don't get zooms or because I'm not learning anything at all, and IM practically bribed to cheat so dont act as if it's a wonder"
"I used to be such a good student but now I'm failing all my classes except one, I'm not motivated and I try to pay attention but I just can't understand what my teachers are trying to teach us but when I just do it by myself with no teachers I understand almost everything, TikTok literally helped me and I understood freaking high school stuff with the TikTok tutors and I'm in middle school... I got so much anxiety to the point I can't breathe especially when my school calls, About the not understanding what my teachers are telling us has always been like that though... I just told my parents this year cause I was having a harder time but they got mad at me 😅"
"I’m failing all of my classes and I can’t find myself going to class because of fear of being called out..."
"If students can play sports such as football, basketball, etc, then they can attend school in person.  Virtual school is a joke.  Nothing replaces the traditional physical classroom setting."
"I remember begging my mom to let me be homeschooled or to just do online school... COVID has me changing my mind bcuz I CANNOT HANDLE THIS ANYMORE"
"they need to just finish school now, people are failing and having depression because there failing and they never do but this school year is WAY diffrent, my dad said ""it should be easier this year because your at home"" but its the opposite. its much HARDER and he doesn't understand that and neither do the teachers."
"Tbh we should just stay home and repeat grade next in real school"
"I’m failing a required class and I’m a senior with only a week left of school. It’s so hard to find that motivation to do your work. I’d rather just dig my grave and bury myself in it instead of facing the embarrassment of not graduating"
"I have a lot of Missing assignments and I just dont feel going anymore and i also have alot of absents and tardies"
"I failed all of my first marking period classes with 40 and 50s im not passing this marking period either =( i hate school"
"I went out of freshman year with more As than Bs, now in sophomore year I’m sitting on two Fs, Cs and Ds, and a few As. The end of the semester feels like the end of the year because I want it to end just for a few weeks
"
"Very Impressive. I think, if online learning on going as representation of post-humanism there education will end."
"I’m failing and I don’t know what to do. We just started in person again and I keep on getting yelled at by my teachers and I’m scared to go back
"
I’m pretty sure the majority has failed because we aren’t used to learning from home rather than school to get that same experience with our friends and teachers around to help
"when I got stressed out over not being able to adapt to the situation of how online school was not meant for me, I practically gave up because I didn’t wanna stress myself out more"
"I hate my life ....i rather die than failing all my classes like this, binge in school for 8 years and suddenly online school.....get real life"
"My grades are higher than before, but I’m still failing, and I just wanna go to highschool man"
"I’ve been a straight A student my entire school career, I’ve been failing so many tests in Virtual learning"
I missed the day that I get B+ and A’s. And pandemic let me know the importance of social interaction. WE NEED TO GET BACK TO SCHOOL ASAP! That’s what school for! To help and support each other to learn.
"I’m in my high school years freshman online: and failing 2 of my course class, I  think I have to re-do them next year, as a sophomore. So fk up, I cried like 4 day because of this. I get both below 70, and I never get such a bad grade IN MY LIFE."
"Im from cali and before all this i had a 2.6 gpa pretty average grades life was good now I have a 0.5 gpa im in 9th grade and was excited for highschool but not anymore now I want to start a new life not suffer through all this bullshit."
"teachers don't care if we learned, they only care if we get a good grade. i hate it here"
"Seems like I'm not the only one who used to be a good student and now I'm literally failing
"
"Bruh Im probably gonna go to summer school because these damn teachers gave me 5 projects at once and don't even bother to give out any make up work"
"I can't believe they still want us too take big test's like the STARR test to pass the school year. They should really be more understanding and empathetic to us because we are struggling as well and they need to just let us pass and to give us break until everything goes back to normal"
"I'm tired. I'm losing hope. I can't do this any longer. I want to die."
"I’ve had pretty much a’s for all my years of school and now im finna fail 8th grade they need to do something about this."
"I don't know why my teachers are giving us more work during quarantine then they used too. And the apps we have to use don't explain or show us lessons good at all."
"lets me know that i'm not alone in failing this piece of sackshit and that i'm having the same problems like ""used to be A-B student, demotivated, failing almost everything, feel like im gonna repeat this grade, id rather die from covid than fail and not graduate"", im one of them"
"Im literally about to stay back because of this shit... My parents also take away everything because of my grades.. i was all a's and b's until this year..."
"the thing that annoys me is my parents fail to realize I HAD GOOD GRADES IN REGULAR SCHOOLS AND WHEN I START TO FAIL CAUSE OF THIS THEY GET MAD :/"
"The work, stress, and exhaustion of online school is the cause of failing grades!...I just want this to be over😰😓"
"I tried reaching out to my counselor before because I was struggling, and they looked at my grades and told me that I was being too hard on myself. I’m currently failing all of my classes. I emailed my teachers to ask for an action plan, and my anxiety’s going through the roof, but I’m trying! I’m trying!!!!!"
"Man I’m sitting here losing my mind, first day of online I didn’t like it, just full blown gaming more and more, and now I’ve got everything taken away literally don’t like this online thing rather go back to actual school"

"I actually began to cry when I realized that I probably failed my previous two classes. I felt a lot of stress about it; I began to wonder if my job was at fault because I'm an essential worker from a grocery store. No matter how I tried to keep up, I couldn't really focus at home. When I found this video, it all clicked that I actually did well before the pandemic happened because I used to be able to walk into my campus library to read my required papers to study and complete homework assignments more independently. It was so easy to go to campus to relax in the library. My mom may have initially reacted disappointed at first, but I also realized that she doesn't necessarily remember the reality of being able to learn from failure. I learned a lot from the previous fall semester, so I already know what to do next."
"At this rate they should just let the people who actually try to let them pass this year cause they overwhelmed us with to much work when a pandemic is going on"

My dog died, i got taken away from my dad, my mom is really controling, i lost all of my friends, and now im most likely going to be held back. I really dont see the point in living anymore. My mom literally puts me in a new school every month. I would be doing so good if she just let me stay in one school. everytime she makes me go to another school, my grades go even farther down because im not caught up with whats in that new school. so she moves me to another one, another one, and another one. its just making it worse. God i hate my self so much, im ugly, stupid, and one of the worst sons someone could ask for, and i know it too. My mom made up all these lies about my dad to drive him out of my life. on my dads side, we were all best friends, we all loved eachother, watching movies, going to the pool. on my moms side everyone hates eachother, my grandpa hates me, my grandma hates me, my mom hates me, my brother hates me, I hate me. i dont know what to do."

"My freshman year I failed all my classes cause of this"
"Oh the times where I got good grades... I’m failing most classes now."
"I hate online school I used to have amazing grades, until now which my parents keep yelling at me for having bad grades and make me feel like a failure. They say that they're trying to help me but if I even say ""but it isn't"" or say ""how is it helping me"" my parents get even madder and yell at me. I feel like they don't even care about my mental health. Other students keep saying, ""oh is super easy"" or ""school is easy as pie"". But sometimes I feel like teachers are giving out double the work just because they think since we're at home we have more time to do work, at this point I haven't learned anything in school."
"The more I think about how bad I’m doing I lose even more motivation. I already messed up in my first semester of high school"
"From my years of conversations with adult students, this comes as no surprise. OnlineEducation is flexible, and ac… "
"I Think everyone in the comments wants to restart their school year"
"I used to be in top set in everything now I don’t get anything I’m always doing the easiest works I feel drained and useless"
"I'm preparing my self mentally, so that when I get held back, I won't care as much."
"If only my parents understood my pain"
"im going to have summer school for failing all of my classes💔"
"Math and science were my favorite subjects and now I hate them both bc online school made them so hard for me. :/"
"No One Asked But, I'm In High School In Mexico and I Really Do Miss School In The United states, I Was There For 13 years. Had A Lots Of good grades Over There, And Now I'm Here In Mexico Failing So Far 4 Classes, Having Lack Of Sleep, Anxiety, Loss Of Apetite, And Lack Of Motivation, Now I Feel Like i'm just a failure with no future, and My Parents told me if i fail one more class i will have to drop out of school and start working..."
"Idk its like im not motivated to do school its hard with out a teacher helping on a question thats hard ."
"Yeah nope I’m going to fail 2 core classes and I’m so tired and I just want a hug from my parents letting me know everything will be alright. This is the first time I’ve ever failed a core class and I’m devastated because when I went to school I was a straight A’s and B’s now I’m C’s, D’s, and F’s I wanna cry too."
"I thought I was the only one who had this problem. I had straight A’s last year, I never cheated in school, and I always paid attention and the teachers explained everything well. But these past 6 months I haven’t been doing very well, my A’s are turning to B’s and C’s, my teachers are trying their best to explain but I don’t understand it at all. They need to send it back because this is not easy and I’m sick of it"
"I've never had that phase were I was smart and now an idiot, I am naturally stupid ;-;"
"im a parent im praying for u guys! life is still worth living rather u faill or pass ive got this shit"
"It’s true I failed my first class ever"
"I’m failing all my class and the teacher keep pressuring me and they think I’m dumb and stupid because whenever I send them an email it took them 3-4 day to reply and I’ve ask them for help they never help
"
"During in person school, my grades were super high. I had all A's and B's and my parents were proud of me. But ever since online school, I've basically had all F's this entire year. It is so hard to focus during the online classes for me. My parents have decided I'm going to be held back. I'm scared, but I'm honestly just glad I can go back to in person school. But hey, i see everyone in the comments here. We're all in this together, really. So many kids around the world are going through the same thing. We can do this"
"Help my parents would kill me if I have to repeat a grade and... I think I'm gonna have to repeat a grade."
"I was like willing to become a professional but once the pandemic came... I don't think I will. I can't help but cheat and blank out everytime during class. I’m not failing but ever since I had co-op (which is basically volunteer work but mine was online) I have zero focus because within those past months I ain't was doing shit...Now I have math and it's killing me 😭"
"Bruh like I feel like their not even stopping it due to the fact that they probably just want us to graduate on time we’ll I mean sheesh I don’t mind spending some more time with my mom before I go to college I just want this nightmare to end it’s honestly a disaster I’ve never had so little determination and motivation to do my work. I can’t take this anymore it needs to end"
"I’m a junior in high school and I have so many distractions at home and my mental health is at my lowest because of online school. I had to stop going to therapy and I can’t get diagnosed for some mental issues that have taken a toll on me. I’ve always been the one to get grades no lower than an 80%, but now I’m failing almost every class. Clearly, my mom doesn’t understand why I’ve given up."
"I think I'm gonna lose my A-Level maths because of the remote learning but luckily I still have another year in my secondary school"
"i passed all my final semester exams but still had doggy grades man cant they just stop online school until the vaccine?"
"With online schooling, there is absolutely nothing to look forward to. Back when things were normal, there were parts of school that had me excited. Chatting with friends, getting to know the teachers, sports events, etc. Now with online, there is none of that. It feels more like a chore more than anything! friends I made before probably forgot about my existence by now. School inside of your house just isn't right. It is not the right environment because home is usually a place to unwind and relax AFTER school. We miss out on tons of things and at this point, I don't even feel like a student anymore. Online schooling and just lockdown in general turns your home into a prison cell. No escape."
"I can't take this anymore CAN Y'ALL JUST LISTEN. Is students here ever since online school came we've been failing and we don't like it, we get grounded, we feel depressed, feel like failures we don't want this anymore. We want to go back to school in person now!"
"I couldn't tell you a single thing I've learned this year. That's how pointless E-School is.. It's all trying to get a good grade, not trying to learn.."
"im failing math and my depression is making it hard to put any effort in.
"
"....I've actually done way better! I've been getting A's in math, French, geography and art when before I was getting B's at best. But I think the reason is because my teachers a younger and let our chatroom ne welcoming like a discord call and we get to joke around and stuff!"
"The teachers I have for online learning don’t do their job they just make my class watch videos :("
"Man the good days when my parents dont have problems with me and my teacher now evey time i hear a notification i just go full anxiety mode"
"I've never received a grade lower than a B+ before and I've basically had straight A's since middle school, but now I'm failing a class and have mostly D's and C's... i feel like a failure and it sucks because I'm junior this year and colleges look the most at your junior and senior year. I don't know what to do anymore."
"failed first semester on the verge of failing 2nd.i’m a junior & i didn’t even take the act i think my life is over ..
"
"I remember when i had 100% and low as 90% in all classes i had now in online class I have 6 F's like wtf. May i wish you well to the people with good grades :'("
"It's either running away and killing yourself or dealing with school depression and Corona until you drop 
I guess I'm with the angels then cause I can't take it anymore 😇😇😭😭😭😇😇"
"i feel like such an idiot cuz most of my friends are going to high school and i'll just be that one idiot who couldn't pass cuz online school and my distractions like video games. I felt better after reading the comments cuz I realize that I am not alone and that there are others who are dealing with the same issue as me"
"I've gave up on getting good grades, I thought online would be easier so it isn't. I'm just using that time to draw now :/"
"I never failed a single class in my life but I will on like math etc"
"I’m in a private school I’m just wondering will my teachers give me the answers just like the before in the first semester"
"Im F Done With Online School Id be In the Streets Starving for all i care for For Expectations From my Family And Relatives 😭😭."
"Honestly I've done online school 2 times now and the 1st time I didn't go to 8th grade and then I went to school in person and passed, but now that I'm doing it again I'm failing and won't go to high school... I honestly feel like I'm just gonna run away if I don't graduate again"
"I'm sure of it now. If I ever end up in rehab, it'll be from online school."
"We need to fight back against the grading its unfair and making us all feel like we're overwhelmed with work we don't deserve, we need to stop the systems from providing us this much work."
"I’ve been depressed and this online school is a bit more difficult. i feel like i’m not gonna pass the 11th grade but i won’t give up"
"Sleep during classes go to the gym because I’m failing classes has to pick grades up because of athletics. Ah yes a cycle"
"I guarantee if we were working in class, we all would not be failing. I almost failed the first half of the year but saved my self at the end. Now I’m taking finals and I really do not want to repeat this year. I just cannot do this. From Jan to now I have been so stressed about my grades. I think hybrid is dumb because you are literally doing the same stuff in a different building smh. I fear, fear, FEAR ,fear the word missing now."
"tell me how i went 9 years of school NEVER getting deficiencies, failing classes or getting grades lower than 80, now we're doing online school and i am struggling so hard. I am failing all of my 4 core classes which means ill probably have to retake them or get held back. we have shit going on at home bro, we have little siblings to look after and we are not made to learn in our bedrooms through a computer screen. i think school should be put on pause while we are social distancing or not make school mandatory or use our quarantine grades against us. i hate this so much I've never considered dropping out but now its something that i wish i could do."
"they give use like 3 projects each class and want them finished the next day it’s not like i’m trina grind homework like it’s a game"
"You know what’s making us fail CORONAVIRUS 💯😓"
"Well then make a rule that teachers cant give to much damn work
"
"I remember when I had straight A’s last year and since my school thought I was smart last year they put me in honors and now I’m failing and my brain is melting rn😭😓"
"It’s so damn difficult to do online school but I don’t wanna infect myself or my family with COVID-19.. And every time I look at if there’s any work I don’t see it then they say “It was there!” I stopped going to my classes for many weeks because I was upset that my dog died while I was in class and ever since I’ve left everything important behind. I wanna fix it but I know I’m gonna fail. I wish I can undo my mistakes but it’s too late."
"Bro i basically never joined online classes last year so this year i am basically suffering getting 50 average grade how can i improve myself"
"I hate online school, I was doing so good until online now I am failing 3 classes!!!!! When we came back it
 was IMPOSSIBLE to learn anything 😭 now I may have to repeat a grade"
"Holy shit this is the first time I got a 0 in any of my classes

"My grades were good until online learning. I basically failed my first semester of junior year 😑"
"The highschool grade averages in my school are extremely high"
"School is part of the reason of my suicidal thoughts"
"I do bad at online school and makes me depressed sometimes when I think about it

"I CANT TAKE THIS ANYMORE. I HAVE TO WAKE UP IN 6 HOURS FOR SCHOOL. GOSH PLEASE CANCEL SCHOOL."
"I just got my first D on university AND IN MY LIFE BRO. I’m trying not to cry"
"Before SARS-CoV-2, I had Cs to As. But then when I moved into Online School, it changed everything. I was starting to earn straight A+ all of my classes. I think I am considering myself as a online learner survivor."
"i have to repeat my last year of middle school because of covid ."
"The thing is that there is way more work in online school that is stressing us out and causing depression  and very sadness"
"I was finally getting good grades and now...  I'm failing all my classes. Sounds like drama but I'm feeling so depressed and I just wanna disappear idk
"
"I’m gonna fail all my exams next year I KNOW it. Why? Because I’m on medication which has RUINED my memory and I can’t remember anything. Can’t wait to come off it."
"i am normally a 4.0 GPA and have been for the past 6 years! now from online school, i went from 4.0- 3.6"
"I am doing online school. It is so hard and stressful"
"I'M FAILING 5 CLASSES BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC!
I DON'T TRY IN SOME OF CLASSES
I WANNA BE WITH MY FRIENDS!!"
"no high school for me I guess. Gg school you won this time"
"I’m so happy I graduated 1 month before shut down happen the horrors of online classes will make me fail easy"
"honestly idk i could just do all my works and maybe not fail at school IF i had the motivation, which i dont have lol"
"I’ve always been a student with good grades, As and Bs but during this pandemic I don’t have one passing grade at this moment everything is stressful there’s so many distractions at home, I can’t focus or anything remotely close and I’m glad to hear I’m not the only one like this so if I fail this year I’ll be hurt but I’ll know why at least."
"I'm still an A grade student. But I'm kind of losing my sanity as well. Trying to keep up with these thousands of assignments is annoying and tiring. It's worse that we have to sit in front of a computer screen for 7 hours of classes, 5 days a week. And then more hours because the assignments are online. We have to still wake up early. Alot of us are still not getting our sleep and are stressed out in general from other things too. I'm thankful that Lord Jesus Christ has been helping me get through this school year."
"They need to put us to our grade because this year is terrible for us"
"I literally do not know what to do anymore, I'm failing all my classes and have gotten nothing but F's. It's almost the end of the school year and I still have no motivation, I'm definitely. gonna have to repeat. Instead of my mom trying to work with me she just calls me a piece of shit and saying I don't deserve anything. I'm stressed and whenever I try to do my work everything goes wrong. I've missed so many days and so many assignments. My mom started beating me up, tbh I think I would do better if I lived at my dads. He does anything to support me. I don't know what to do,"
"I'm literally 13 and I'm stressing over my grades when I should be enjoying life. Sent my teacher an email yesterday asking them if they could take my late points off and they said no, how do you expect me to get a good grade if you take off half of the points when it's late? Honestly, it's so hard to find any motivation to finish work on time, and when I don't I just get even more stressed trying to finish it all at the last minute, so now I'm stuck with an F in one of my classes and I'm just scared of what my parents are going to say if they ever see my grades, my parents get angry if I have B's so I don't even wanna think about what they will say when they see I have C's D's and an F when I used to get A's and B's. I don't even know what I'm gonna do about my grades (if I can even do anything) and I just want it all to end. Hopefully, I don't have to take summer school for failing one quarter and hopefully, they don't send my mom an email either because I'm seriously considering just hiding it all from her, I don't think my mental health can handle her yelling at me because of grades :(

"I know I am not the only one that was a Straight A or AandB student before quarantine."
"I don’t know why I’m not doing that well. It seems like it should be easier."
"i searched this up to make me feel better because i am failing and i’ve never done bad in school before. i’m so scared i’m going to have to repeat a gradw"
"thx god im not the only one haveing bad grades"
"If anyone fails this year come back tell me cuz I feel like I will"
"I remember when they didn’t give as much work"
"I hate online school I would always do fine in regular school it makes me feel so fing dumb when I saw my grades knowing that I can’t even do anything about"
"I’m doing good 😌"
"I hate this! I have been fine all my life with grades and school performance up until 8th grade. Then it was my first year of high-school, in a horrible online school format. It was so hard for me in this format, I was getting stressed, lost the grip, my grades dropped. My dream of becoming a pro soccer player, im starting to lose motivation, im not training enough! Now im thinking what will colleges think? Will they care? They probally will, now I have to wait until on campus school resumes, so I can regain confidence, and that doesn't sound like any time soon at this point :(((((("
"Online school is a SET UP. We need to protest. This is so unfair"
"This goes for College Students as  well"
"as of now feb of 2021 im doing really well with online my teachers are understanding and it really helps my grades before covid were good but now they are higher and i like it that way , having As and Bs are good for me and the assightments are easy for me to do and  due to recent weather events i was off school online for this whole week , and then i go back for 2 weeks and then i get spring break as a junior rn its great"
"I’m failing it’s so stressful"
"im not even that sad that i failed im just happy this year is finally over"
"I used to get straight A+’s. Now i am getting B’s, C’s, and A’s. I know its my fault but I just cant do it. I will sit staring at the screen for 20 minutes and then realize ive dont nothing. I just cant do it. I would rather stare at a blank wall instead of working on it"
"I’ve been having suicidal thoughts and am so stressed out about school.. I have already failed my first semester and now I’m already failing this semester I’m so tired of it all"
"I’m literally almost done at this point. The only reason why I’m passing very barely is because I’m doing my best for my mom."
"To be honest I feel trapped. I don't wanna tell my parents because they will probably think Ima failure , and I will probably cry infront of them. Anyways I'm falling every subject but not Pe, and history..."
"I came into high school expecting hell but not this....."
"I been getting really good grades and when online school struck BOOMMMM grades be dropping hard"
"Sucks to walk into 9th grade after getting good grades in middle school now Im stuck with straight Fs in my semester."
"Sitting here with 178 unfinished and incomplete assignments 🤡🥴"
"I know I'm about to repeat 10th grade. At the beginning I was getting passing grades, but then a bunch of stuff happend last year and this year. So I just didn't feel motivated to even attend class I couldn't really pay attention. I ended up just not attending and doing the work. But I didn't  just do nothing at home of I started to go hard on learning languages, doing a bunch of house work, working on my self ect. I don't think I'll regret repeating tbh."
"This is true. Kids at home are getting way less attention than in person students. It's also way harder to pay attention since they're at home. Reaching out for help is very difficult with social pressure. And schools suicide rates have gone way up. I know that there are MANY more people considering suicide too."
"I’m failing my classes because of online school, this is why we need no school"
"Mannn i was making good grades not until homeboy corona come in"
"I’m not very smart but I used to always have a final average of 70 in all my life. Now I have a 55. I have a 0 in 2 clases"
"It's very easy for children to get distracted on devices with videos and games. Hmm... could this also be an issue with learning online. Kids rather be playing games then listening to boring lessons from school. Think about it. Kids need to be in a safe classroom without a muzzle on their face around other kids which would help motivate them. Being in a quiet room at home trying to focus isn't the same."
"Thats what happens when you mommy state people in school and then make them go virtual."
"This is so underrated by parents."
"Online school doesn’t even help me learn!"
"Online school is exhausting I don't even learn anything I miss the old style of schools"
"I seriously want all of my teachers, school, and the government to read this comment section. This is how we all feel. I’m in high classes and I feel this way. Kids of under average, average, advanced, ap etc classes are dealing with this same feeling. Of course it seems as though they’d never listen."

"I should be ""graduating"" next week but instead I decided not to participate because I don't even know if i'm going to graduate because of how much I neglected my school work. I used to be on top when it comes to my grades, I even enjoy going to school believe it or not. Remote learning has taken such a toll on me.. I applied to 5 universities and I got in 4 of them which includes my top 2 that I want to attend to. I hate myself that my acceptance could highly be forfeited for having a bad last semester..."
"I love how I went from make nothing below a c to failing 8th grade"
"To be honest this is giving me stress"
"Ah I used to get the best grades now I am failing I am a idiot"
"I'm in grad school and I've literally learned nothing through the Zoom meetings. The quality is crap and it is hard to stay motivated when you miss the interaction with other students. I'm concerned about passing comprehensive exams. I'm also living with fibromyalgia so it's hard to concentrate due to brain fog and being depressed, but staying home also allows me to conserve energy. But online school is such a drag nonetheless."
"ever since online school ive felt even more dumb day by day"
"Honestly, the big issue is that we students were forced to put our education above all. We're literally in an pandemic and people are more worried about passing because of what others will think. This whole year I was struggling with depression because I force into isolation. This year should have been the year where our guardians and schools put pre-covid expectations on us. I feel like it would have been way better on everyone if people in authority cared about our mental healths- instead of overwhelming us with mountains of assignments. Expecting us to do them in unreasonable timeframes. Plus, majority of us stopped being kids when we had to join the work field to support our families. But ofc.. they don't care. Didn't even care when my classmates had covid. All they said was feel better but don't get behind on assignments. Smh"
"I've always been scared of being a failure and now I'm close to failing school, I honestly just want to drop out and disappear.

"Teachers in my online class be like ok so what is the answer of 3x2 meanwhile the assignments are like if Jimmy kicked a soccer ball 10 meters, what is X×4 added with the volume of the sun"

"I’m close to having to repeat the 8th grade and it’s depressing"
"I feel bad for teachers and students 
Students are overwhelmed and unmotivated 
Many teachers are underpaid and go through a lot of stress 
I’m on both sides,Students and teachers deserve better,especially the students,your mental health is more important that getting a freakin A+"
"i wonder how many hecking failing grades theyre gonna pass out this year."
"What? Not me. I have excellent grades in virtual learning. But like attending schools in person. You have to put in effort, time and work into becoming successful in school, you also need to make sure the schools meet your needs and get help from tutors. I hope this issue gets solved."
"this is my first year in middle school and i’m already failing i need help this is such bullshit"
"I got straight Fs rn😭😭my dad came over yesterday because he seen my grades and threatened to beat me"
"I passed the 9th grade yes barely tho but for those who haven't passed then just don't stress over it just enjoy your summer while you can Wake up to reality! Nothing ever goes as planned in this world. The longer you live, the more you realize that in this reality only pain, suffering and futility exist."""
"I have had f’s on two of my classes all year.. guys plis tell me if I will have to repeat because of this... :("
"At my school there assigning more hw😭😭"

"I thought it be more easy doing online but NNOOO I'm failing and now I'm being forced to go back to school in person because of my grades not just me they are doing this to every kid who is failing"
"I don't even feel like I'm learning anything in online school."
"I use to be average in school, but when online class came along I don't think I cried more in my entire life
Considering novody here knows me I have barely enough confidence to say this..
School makes me feel like a failure even when I get good grades, and during online school there are passive aggressive comments when I try to add my own small spin on things (in english) and when I have a break I don't feel like I deserve it and that I should be doing work again because I don't deserve that break I should be catching up in math, life science, english, geography, and all my other classes but I just can't because I'm to busy hiding from my own parents because I'm scared of them judging me and considering me a failure even though they've told me multiple time that they won't do that and I know they won't but that fear overides that, and my friend is usually busy aswell and shes one of the few reasons I can get myself back together and function but we barely talk anymore because online school is taking up more time then homework did, so now I can't call her or talk to her because shes busy so all I can do is bottle it up and hope I don't cry even though crying makes me feel much better but I don't want to cry because theres more important things to cry about then just some school work, and it doesn't help that even before this I bottled up my emotions because I considered then 'irrelevent' and an 'overreaction' and now I don't know what to think anymore, I still consider crying over such things to be an overreaction and stupid because it is but crying is natural and its confusing me snd now I just want to cry more but now I'm having the same problem and its just a never ending loop of wanting to cry but not crying because of the same reason.."
"Good thing I take my online classes in my garden, is more peaceful there"
"This why kids been jumping in the street life cuz school is pointless, while they say Noo stay in school now I see why"
"You really wanna know what would make us pass give us less and less and less and less work no test should be over 10 questions no quiz should be over 5 questions no writing essays no taking pictures of notes and sending it to teachers because that’s just too much no more having the students cut their cameras on because we all tryna cheat we not tryna do this work fr y’all not teaching us how to flip 50 dollars into 1k so we don’t need to take it that seriously especially highschoolers"
"I think its the fact that we have to do way more assignments in virtual school i have to do 3 assignments in each class and thats 15 each week and it gets overwhelming because it piles up if you dont do them in time"
"IM ON MY FRICKING WAY TO NOT PASS BECAUSE OF LESS MOTIVATION AND STRESS"

"I used to be a 4.0 and 3.5 student now im a 4.0 Student only. I love online school it’s so easy and right after my last class I can go right in my bed or watch TV since my teachers don’t give homework because we’re already home lol 😂 I I hope we never go back to real school"
"Bruh before the lockdown my brain was Einstein mode now my brain has brain damage"
"I think, over the pandemic, they should've just stopped school altogether, and had kids take their exams early when the pandemic was in its early stages. And resume everything when given the OK by medical health experts like Dr. Fauci. Online schooling just doesn't work."
"i failed second grade 289 missing assignments because im dumb"
"I'm going to repeat my 11th grade year. Thank God my dream college doesn't care about a single repeat. Still this whole situation is bullshit"
"Im sad, im a freshman about to fail two quarters the quarter ends tomorrow and its 11pm, ima have to repeat 9th grade at this point. I'm a failure, anyone got a backup plan I could do in case I can't graduate  😭"
"It's stupid how they force us to turn our camera on and record videos of us exercises or something like that. ITS OUR HOME YOU CANT FORCE US TO TURN OUR CAMERA ON. It's literally illegal. A teacher literally said he would put in zeros if we didn't turn our camera on. Some of us have many reasons as to why we cant or refuse to, like bad conditions at home, insecurities, shyness or just simply aren't up and ready.🙄"
"please I feel like I'm not even gonna graduate since my internet isn't working that much and it isn't letting me do my homework and the emails I'm sending to my teachers are me asking for help and they aren't responding, it's been months and I'm supposed to graduate this may"

"I used to remember to have a stable and balance good grade when the pandemic didn't happened yet but after months of online classes I began failing :(("
"My online school year this year has been going just... Hell lmao i never even wanted online school this year and ive got to deal with such b s all the time. Its especially hard when u have an easily confused student manager. Also the hw amount i have is just absurd, especially in us history like people dont understand how much work it is, and im gettin real real tired of this crap."
"I'm in a really bad situation right now. The deadline is tomorrow and I haven't done anything."
"I had a teacher tell me you can throw this year away or use it to better yourselves. I have yet to decide what to do. I work better alone and the first couple of months I was getting 100s which is more than the grades I got in regular school, 95s, and no I was not cheating. They were both As but when moving on to the next grade it just got harder. I spent my summer trying to get ahead on my fall classes in hopes that I would not fail however all this did was add more pressure on myself. I am not actually assigned a lot of homework since there has been complaints at my school but it feels like more homework than before due to the lack of motivation and doing everything at home that we would usually do at school. I just want things to go back to normal but that is not likely to happen anytime soon."
"I'm failing my two classes it's really stressful"
"If I fail I would blame it on the pandemic"
"The first semester was the WORST, Because I was doing online. Then the second semester I went back to normal (in person) school and my grades at a little better, but I was worried that It would not be enough time to help my grades😃It’s honestly so annoying and they should just let most of us pass bcz of covid, or let us do summer school for a week or two "
"I don't wanna fail"
"Broooo my college isn't even giving us a spring break."
"i feel so dumb and heavy now, the one thing i was good at , my subjects and grades, are just all going away all my hard work gone, the only thing i was good at, and i feel so alone and i’m just overall scared to be held back and disappoint my parents and family name,
"
"The school system is messed up enough but now there’s mixed classes full online and “safe in person” none of them work well enough for kids to actually absorb the information. Get called at least once a day about a covid case in school if there’s that much issues with in person shut it down and kids obviously can’t learn online either so we are putting kids health at risk or we are mentally draining them. School needs to shut down until it can open fully"
"i did better in public school, my grades going down lol"
"Can vouch. Have to repeat a class because of it. 😔"
"Last year I was a role model now it’s gotten worse"
"I failed, my grades are getting lower than before, i got C and D. And also im not on the top in class this year unlike before... My mental health is very unstable and it's tiring me as days goes by. My anxiety is growing larger and I'm afraid that it'll get worse. I'm trying to fix myself and try keeping myself alive. It may seem that I'm smiling and act like im okay but I'm really dying inside. I hope I have the courage to tell these things to my parent's and friends but I'm such a coward for fearing for judgements towards me.  I want to say sorry to my parent's, friends and teacher's bc i can't do the expectations u want for me :( i miss the good old days :("
"Out of 1000 kids at my school 300+ are failing"

"I think one thing is that zoom classes should NOT be mandatory, zoom classes make kids so tried and makes them want to go play games, they should be able to go to zoom classes and or should do work without classes, I think I did better without zoom calls, since it feel way too much as a burden since no one talks and it's so boring, teachers should make a video post it sent it to kids and kids can email them questions"

I want to get back at school,and interact with people"
"What about children with learning disabilities that are IN SCHOOL failing due to this virtual crap."
"I fill so much better that everyone else on here is failing always got amazing grades"
"These school systems are not “worried about their students,” They are worried for their reputation as a good school system. Imagine you were a school district administrator, and your school system was known for having students constantly fail, miss class, and skip school. How would you feel? Pretty horrible, right?"
"I'm comforted to know I'm not the only kid who had good grades until online school where I'm lower ones. The only thing that's keeping me from just basically giving up is my parents would be sad and disappointed if I didn't try. Also its so stressful with all the bugs and the teachers being idiots with tech and how in middle school they're basically trusting kids to manage their time responsibly and god knows a bunch of middle schoolers are gonna get in the procrastination loop (including me) and be confused by this crap that the education system is flinging at us online learners. In online school I feel like there's less work but its harder to do because you spend like an hour on a worthless zoom meeting where it could be summed up in ten minutes and after wasting time they go ""here's the assignment"" without giving us time in class. And don't even get me started on teachers missing my grades/not updating them. Sorry about the rant I'm just frustrated with this system that will hopefully get better as time goes on."
"It’s even worse in college when the professors put out the lectures and don’t have set lecture times and us having to teach ourselves... (btw I know of office hrs but I have labs during their office hrs so I can’t go to them)"
"The home school platform I use is K-12 and it's sucks, I don't think I would start high school this way."
"And of course the teacher blames the parents. No, A hole, us parents are just as stressed and clueless as the students. The course work and tests are garbage."
"The one thing thats making things really difficult are quadmesters. Im sorry going on the same subject for 3 hours is cruel. Breaks help but aren't the solution. Its like lifting weights, when you lift weights, you're tearing your muscles. The longer you lift weights the more muscles you rip. Taking a break helps but your muscles is still teared. The transition from 1st to 2nd period always gets my head refreshed, but now double periods are so tiresome, most teachers think a 10 minuete break refills your energy like we're a sand timer."

Its so stupid that they have different ""programs"" and if you are fully remote then you cant get your work on paper even though im 100 percent that would help me bring my grades back up is my work on paper. theres so many things i have to master in just weeks? absolute insanity..."

"Back then my quarterly grade was 89, 88 (Its like the phillipine grading) but now for the first time my quarterly grade is 78, it showed on my report card and I haven't showed it to my parents yet cause they said if I fail im never going to school again, Im actually crying when my teacher says something to me, like ''are you two ok? what happened to you and your twin?'' both me and her are dropping and it sucks."

"I am smart and have done good in person, but virtually is way harder. I can't explain things that well, but school shouldn't count this year like it did last year. I am 14 years old and the shit I see on the news scares me because we are getting closer and closer to the end. I have just given up all hope after my science grade I worked so hard to keep at a 95 went down to a 60. I genuinely feel like all hope is lost, and no one gives a damn."
"the problem with online classes is that we already have stress even before the work, theres literally a pandemic, not to mention you have to stay in your house which is designed to distract you, school has never felt more optional so when we have bad days we get distracted and dont do our work, which snowballs down to not do any work at all"
"I’m just tired because I’m failing all my classes and this is hard doing it online and my parent’s think it’s me but it’s not i feel like I’m not learning anything from it anyway might as well drop out"
"this is the first time my entire life I actually would like to die then to experience failure"
"Most of you all are at least in Jr. High or High school Im assuming.  Interesting to read these comments and see how disengaged students feel, and this leads to lower levels of motivation and higher levels of depression due to isolation and staring at a screen every day. If its bad for adolescents, its even worse on the children I believe. Yet these schools and teachers seem to just simply want to lay blame on the student and parents. Very interesting."
"I cannot bare with school anymore. I am failing EVERY SINGLE CLASS and the highest grade I’ve ever gotten was a D-. I just feel unmotivated to do anything and they throw too much work at me. Hopefully I don’t get held back a grade, I think we all won’t considering too many people are failing."
"I just wanna go to the 8th grade if I’m seriously gonna kms 🥵😒🙁"

"Online school is a breeze. I don’t understand. You have all the time in the world to prepare yourself?"
"I'm sorry if i offend ya'll, but this called Online School is complete Bullcrap. I mean, when i was back at In-person school i didn't really get F's or E's. I most likely got Some Cs and sometines As. But this, can't take it anymore. I have been failing eversince the start of school on September. I can't believe it."

"2021 im still failing and not a couple im failing 10th grade"
"Sucks to be you guys I have REAL school"
"Online school is not helping us. why because of our teachers, our parents telling us that we are never ever gonna pass and that we are failures. we also have a life outside of online school but our teachers want us to finish work rather then letting us take a break. do they not see online school is making us want to kill ourselves? we don`t like online school anymore. we don`t like how our teachers are treating us in online school, and we also don`t like how our parents start to tell us we are just not giving online school our all, we are not doing our best, and etc. I also want online school over with. why can`t the teachers and parents understand what we are going through with online school?"
"I got all A++++ in both real school and online"
"I still have good grades but my teachers are very horrible and they seem to not be working on their classes, they don't teach anything, they only give homework to us, why am I calling these people teachers if they're not teaching."
"I plan on killing myself this summer as Im going to fail school, hope you guys get  better results"
"I rather fail 6th grade only to do it again without learning behind a computer online school is stupid and the education system is completely delusional the only people who understand me are adults who are aware or the youth you guys need to stop online learning or else I won't have a future and my parents will get in trouble aswell as I"
"I don't think its because its covid maybe its that school is uninteresting and boring and useless what there teaching nowadays at least from 6-12 grade"
"I hate virtual technology so freaking much. It’s stupid, it’s going to take away snow days and never give us a break and your being glued to your computer 24/7 which isn’t, healthy for your brain. The whole logic of virtual is basically just forcing yourself to be on your computer all freaking day and do work and I speak form experience. It’s so boring and it makes people leave off their work more than actually being at school."

"Remember when I was a good student 
Now I’m failing and my parents think I have autism 😑 also my stress is a big problem I am failing 2 classes it was all my classes INCLUDING physical Ed’s"
"Its not all because of covid and its not just online school. Online school or public school, covid or no covid. its school, its stress, its depression. Its the way society is, the way the world is it sucks. that's what the problem is. there are people that do care but lets face reality all society wants is for us to graduate get a job so we can give them their money. School has always been a problem no matter what situation. And when I say this a lot of people who say ""well since you sound like you know everything, what is your solution huh!?"". I don't exactly have one Im just saying what needs to be said. it sucks."
"Honestly online schools is inefficient and just something that should have never been created think about it I’m only in 6th grade and I got my first c d and f on my second nine Weeks does that make a bell ring in your head online school is just teachers giving assignments from different sites and not even trying to create them I got a project over winter break that I didn’t know I had I’m already behind and I’m just going to start cheating on my work"
"If you're an A student in person, there's no reason why you can't be an A student online."

"The schools just want funding.... kids are not learning anything.  The kids should be learning in a realistic life way during this time not things of unimportance"
"I hate online school. I am failing all my classes except study skills and P.E. I have no interest in learning anymore. Life is shitty. I want to take a gap semester so I can feel happy. I want to get better grades again. I want to drop out really bad. no socialization."
"I feel like they should just pass everybody to the next grade because now I see it’s the whole world it’s not just me and my friends I’m just tired I said I wanted to go to college and write direct my own movies but forget it I’m not going anywhere I’m tired"
"The reason why am failing is mainly due to the fact that in school you would be bored so work to pass the time but at home I have video games I can play so I wouldn't be bored and to pass time tbh that us why I am failing school my teachers reading this Don't say I don't pay attention is because I am a procrastinator"
"Online school is not going to work whatsoever"
"I’m seeing all these sad and stressed people in the comments and.... dang. I feel you guys. I’ve had decent/good grades until this pandemic. I thought it would be easier until now. We are all dealing with more trouble. The reason why we are doing worse is because we are dealing with a literal pandemic and having a lot of stress. We are also more demotivated to do work at home. But let’s try to get through this, we can do it! Just remember that grades do not define your intelligence, and mental health is more important. School is being forced onto us, but we can get through it. Things were not good, but now they are worse during the pandemic. In school, we have to memorize a bunch of random information. Our intelligence is not measured by how much information we can take in, it is measured by how much we truly know and can do. For example, we can have creative intelligence, which is about our ability to get creative and be smart in different ways, such as thinking about solutions to certain issues. Things may be rough, but I believe we can get through this. We’re in this together! 😁"

"This isn't even the student fault if they try or they care about there grades. Virtual Online Classes they give more assignments and more homework that they give than physically going to school. They need to decrease the work. The second issue is that there are too many students. And when you ask a question you probably can't ask again because the teacher has to move on her or his lesson. That's the problem, student's can't just learn like that. They don't have the same brain. Every student is different. Tutoring is a waste of time as well. The only option is having atleast 8 or 9 kids with one teacher. That is more better comparing 30 students with 1 teacher. I as a student who goes with atleast 24 students and even more, I don't even learn from the teachers I learned by memorizing and reviewing. The teachers aren't even teaching. There just showing us lessons. Depending on which or what teacher you have. Online Classes needs to be more easier."

"I miss normal school.. This online school for me personally has been AWFUL! I have never been so stressed out in my life for school. It's difficult to pay attention, staring at a computer screen.. No matter what I do... Hurts my eyes and I have more headaches than ever. I have the worst Wi-Fi connection and have missed so much school, notes, and so much more and I am having the worst time trying to keep up. It's my senior year and I feel like I'm not gonna graduate because of this.. I'm exhausted all the time, can hardly understand the teachers and have had so many panic attacks and anxiety attacks, that are making things worse no matter what I do, and it ruins my want to even do school... I love school but with all this online school.. I honestly just feel like I don't even want to do anything anymore and it makes me so upset and just drained.."

He was so hurt, and disappointed, I had to quickly go into my preschool teacher mode and start my lesson plans that I have been doing since late March, and the strawberry donut with sprinkles!Later hiding my tears at this epic fail!  Today things were only slightly better.  We got log in and he at least saw some kids in his class.  Very limited instruction and the computer was slow and the camera teacher didn’t have the skills to keep the camera working.

I want to help my mom by getting through high school cause she said it would be fine if i passed highschool and she wouldn't care if i didn't go to college after that But it's just difficult because for months I'm still not used to online schooling
"For my family, virtual learning has both pros and cons. Pro: I get to be more involved in my children's learning. I get to see what each child needs help with. On Google Meets, I get to see the teacher's teaching style, which is very enlightening. Cons: many teachers requires students to do a lot more work than they do in the classroom. We have had to work on schoolwork until bedtime several times. Some online programs are so very poorly designed, resulting in a lot of frustration and no learning. For my family, distance learning would be ideal if we used BOOKS instead of computers. Even though there are challenges, I would rather my kids do distance learning, even virtual learning, than risk catching covid."

My contract is for 187 days. Do some quick math, and to educate your kid, you will see that I make just over a buck fifty a day to teach, guide, babysit  your kid. Trust me, you’re getting a deal. You don’t know how to help your kid? LEARN! You wanna get paid for teaching your kid?

"Yeah all that make a schedule BS... come on. That’s something we do daily regardless if the kids are in school or out of school. The real issue is Esperance no longer able to work having to stay home and do a teacher’s job. It’s hard enough navigating through the computer in links what about in situations where your child needs a little bit more one on one to help them learn in general? I’ve brought this up to my local school district their response was well teachers had to learn a lot this year as well that’s what they get paid to do that’s not what I paid to do. I gave them the example when they got home from work they had to get on Skype with their husbands boss and have him explain how to remove a transmission rebuild it and reinstall I don’t care how good of a communicator the boss is or how detailed he is you are not going to be able to do that job"
"i got some decent grades

"It all depends on the teachers as well the teachers at the school that my grandchildren attend are great if they see the children falling back they do 1 on 1 activities reading math and help with anything needed and its Liberty Elementary school and Ashburton middle and Elementary school they have been great if uou are having any problems speak with the principle of your schools as well"
"Honestly, as a student myself, the kids are still trying to adapt into remote learning while on the other hand they are receiving lots of assignments and work to do which can lead to a breakdown or depression, remote school won't make us the same, in my opinion."
"How is this structure of learning that's caused so much stress promoting actual learning?  The brain is being flooded with stress hormones and that prevent the retention of information and memory. It seems insane to me. I made the difficult choice of not doing online with my 7 year old. We did more hands on learning and she helped me at my job in an art studio. She was happy and stress free. However the consequences was she got poor grades because she didn't participate. I felt guilty at first. However as and early childhood educator and educational assistant I have an education in childhood brain development. I know deep inside I made the right choice for us. Long term I won't be looking back and remembering her marks but that she was stress free and learning hands on with her mom. Life is so stressful under this pandemic. My priority is to keep out mental health."
"My teacher doesnt pay attention to online kids, meetings start very late, she keeps moving around the room and we cant hear her...this is bad"
"I am an elementary public school teacher.  I don't want to put my family at risk of Covid.  I hate online classes, as well.  I can tell that I am losing the students.  I have tried many ways to keep them engaged, but it just isn't working.  Some students are doing well, but I would say that the majority are failing.  I only assign 1 reading and 1 math assignment, daily.  I thought this was easily doable for my students.  I make sure the assignment correlates with the daily online lesson that I taught.  I give time for students to complete the assignment in class, so they can ask questions, or so I can monitor where the misconceptions are.  However, all of these efforts seem to be for naught.  I have stated several times, since the very beginning, that we should all ""delete"" this school year and redo it.  It is not a popular suggestion, but these kids are having such issues with it, that I believe it is just adding to the already stressed out family.  If we re-do, students get another year to get better grades, because they will get to review all the topics taught.  Success can still happen this way.  Otherwise, the students will not be prepared for the following school year.  They will start out behind in all areas.  I know High school seniors might be an exception to this rule, and they have most of what they need to succeed in the real world, anyway.  The standardized testing to enter college should be waived, this year.  This should not stop seniors from getting into colleges or careers!

"It all depends on the student and sometimes the teacher. There are students who learn better with online as very little distractions. I have cousins who happens to do well in some classes but bad in the others. One said they ended up having a math teacher who has always been bad for years. I have another cousin who feels they are truly learning in health class because that teacher can teach while he ended up with mostly teachers that were bad already pre-Covid. I have friends who are teachers and they say the kids have doing fine with their online learning. The kids who weren’t doing to well had all said their parents were so loud and didn’t know how to control them."

"Why are you bothering with digital learning? Just homeschool like I did. The parent has wonderful curricula to choose from. How on earth can they make kindergarten stressful? Is this for real? Exposure to ABC's, then words, then sentences. Counting, adding oranges, subtracting cookies..... come on people, it's not that hard. And the biggest bonus to homeschooling is that you get to leave out all the leftist propaganda!"
"Parents should not be paid for assisting their own children. I now know that they have an increased respect for Teachers, not that some did not fully appreciate them before the pandemic. They can be took for granted, like so many other things that we've grown accustomed to having. Not to veer away from the topic of discussion but because so many people are out of work in my area (farming town) folks have fell behind on their rent payments and for the first time the owners of the complex that I live in was unable to pay for the trash removal, The trash was half a story high, His hands were tied was what we were told, I took even the trash collectors for granted, I did not think of them. I know that times are beyond hard for many people keep moving forward do the best that you can. Use everything at your disposal and suffer through it! No one asked for a pandemic and all jobs are important, so it's frustrating get rid of the virus; until then figure it out! They were able to pay for the trash removal last Monday.

And this year I moved to another state which was so disorganized than ever that it would get to the point were I would break down crying for a few times so my mom would have to comfort me and help me out because she also thinks that the school system over here is really disorganized and bad.

“Imagine high school and college”college is most stressful because only time you have person to person lecture either it’s a proctor exam or optional face lecture. Half of the colleges don’t teach you shit online so you gotta learn it by yourself with deadlines due end of every week or 3 days.High school online classes you can sleep though it and still have dozen of examples ready for you.So no don’t try to compare high school with college. College online is 100x stressful than on campus and high school.

"Is interesting to see how the whole USA is finally having an epiphany.Tragic to say however, that it takes a virus sweeping the nation. The epiphany is that teacher's need to be more appreciated. This appreciation needs to reflect on their paychecks, which teachers have been fighting for years. Many educators have a salary that qualitatively does not equate to the responsibility they have to take on when it comes to preparing the developing mind to ""function"" in this eternal working society."

"I’ve seen these distance high school classes and a lot of them have the casual air of a collective message board. I can’t blame the teachers because they’re cobbling it together as best they can with what they have but it’s just terrible. There’s no good substitute for being in an actual classroom environment. We really need to open schools as soon as possible and get on track or we’ll ruin a  generation."
"There are a lot of assignments given to students with little to no instructions. Its frustrating to both the parents and students.

"As a someone who was homeschooled myself and also attended public school, I can tell you that traditional homeschooling and at home learning are completely different. At home learning still centers itself around a classroom environment whereas homeschooling is focused on self paced, on your own learning. The problem here is that there isn't any material (workbooks/textbooks) to send home with the children. They are basically watching a lecture online and doing online assignments. The material wasn't designed for online use. It's just being adapted to it. Traditional homeschooling would have content created for home use. I don't think judging the way things are going currently gives an indication of what true homeschooling is like because it only adapts current curriculum to at home. In order to be effective, it would need to be designed for at home use. Only then would I call it homeschooling."

"I hope this helps create an understanding of what teachers have to do multiplied by large class size everyday. Add to that testing pressures, low income, and paying out of pocket. Teachers truly love their kids and interface with them for a large part of the day, for more than half a year. Take care of teachers that take care of your kids."

"Of course same old story but much much worse - the good industrious students will benefit from more self directed study and reading, the vast majority of the others will fall further behind, and many will be irretrievably lost as the final part of the last semester of the school year provides critical advanced topic information and methods. But  the majority of Americans dont care because they not only do not value education they sneer at it. This is why so much of the current response to the epidemic is sorcery and not at all proven via scientific studies ( indiscriminate use of masks, social distancing, staying at home, closing the economy, etc) For the masses and politicians its all about incredibly self-confident declarations based on facts by mere bombastic Hitlerian assertions!  Hence education is of no benefit, its just an unjudicated free for all of highly self-regarded personal opinions no better than reading the entrails of sacrificed animal. We have reverted to the intellectual Dark Ages and those folks thought witchcraft and necromancy was the best path to truth."

"As a senior in high school I have always had straight A’s but I feel that the schooling system has failed me to a point that one assignment or a WiFi mishap is all my fault and as punishment my grade drops drastically. I think that it’s not fair that teachers are obligated to assign many assignments because we students “have no where to be” and that we are “always at home there’s no where to go”. That’ s all redundant to a point that we have siblings, mental issues, other classes, trouble with availability to the internet, and other issues that many have turned a blind eye to. It’s not easy sending an email to teachers, it’s not easy when we are expected to maintain academic integrity with many distractions at home, it’s not easy to have ‘good’ grades when the weighted score is unreasonable for when one missing assignment is worth a letter drop. Now, I fear that I will not even graduate or be accepted into colleges because of this great issue. So, I’d like to thank the education system for screwing me and a lot of other students over."

Even at the beginning of virtual school in August and September my grades were damn near perfect but somewhere in October, my motivation broke and lost myself. I have never failed like this since freshman year.(im a junior btw)I truly think it's the system behind the work and not that it's virtual school that's giving people problems. The overflow of assignments, the strict due dates, the seemingly unforgiving teachers who don't understand we have lives outside of school, it's too much. The best way to fix it, is to not have us join these meetings, unless it is for a test otherwise let us do the work like during the e learning stage when covid first dropped. Otherwise pass everyone this year because there's too many people failing."

Now I have anywhere from 3-5 missing assignments every week because it’s just too much. Also I’m a really social person, so being stuck at my house all day is killing me. I need the routine of real school and in-person interaction to stay motivated. This vaccine couldn’t come any sooner"
"zoom bombing is another huge problem too"
"Students at home don’t work as hard as there are other distractions around such as TV, Video Games, and the fridge with plenty is snacks.   Also, it’s the politicians who are subservient to the teachers unions that allow this.   As a taxpayer , I didn’t receive any monies back due to less physical facilities being used.  The whole education system in some places is a rip off."
"Yeah 'cause their world's been flipped on it's head. Teachers also struggle at helping kids who don't understand the subject, some teachers just don't even put in the effort. Kids have become lazier, with no need to leave the house. They stay up all night into the morning, do their classes, then sleep all day. It's incredibly unhealthy. Please, encourage your kids to be physically active, tell them to sleep on time, go outside and get some sunlight."
"As much as I like to stay at home, and I hate social interactions, I just want to go back because I get lower grades in online class."
"This is my first time failing on school, I used to be a good student but now I'm like the guy who always cut classes(on ftf)."
"Kids getting introduce to college style learning"
"my school just wont take a hint and wont actually do anything helpful about my failing grades"
"So they are just now thinking of giving us extra time on assignments? Can’t believe these people"
"Online school is just depressing. Ive had the urge to dropout, literally. In Nigeria, schools are open for ppl to come back, but in  my year level im one of the 1% out of 80 students that is still doing online. Its been a year, 1 month and still counting. Its depressing"
"Students are falling behind because parents DON'T make sure their kids ACTUALLY do their work! Sorry but drop out rates were EXTREMELY high before the lockdown!"
"What do you expect your giving kids so much work.... And crazy deadlines... multiple classes virtual classes a day. Less work and not such crazy deadlines will help.. online is easier for me. But a lot of work for me.."
"Yes school is really bad for me right now I am failing math and I’m about to fail social studies, I’m trying to get back up to my average grades but it feels impossible my teacher keeps telling me it in the same way as if she wants me to fail."
"Why is this a surprise under the circumstances. I am feeling that some of us are more effected by the Covid-19 circumstances then other people that think it's not real."
"Me an introvert: yey no school
School: introduces online school
Me: yey surely even better :))
School: Same system with homework disguised as school work"
"of course they don't learn anything.  everytime there's a test my sister gets all the answers from the internet. you can cheat good ."
"If there's one thing I learnt is that grades and learning don't necessarily go hand in hand.
And the fact this ""falling behind"" is used as an excuse to ask more money, as money would help learning, make me really lose hope"
"I feel so sad and I suck at math then on top of this my mom says she’s disappointed in me"
"It's happening everywhere. In Texas the Engenuity is 10 times more homework/ class load than the kids normal school day. Basically it's like they set them up for failures so that you have to send them back"
"Might as well drop off 😭 No matter how hard I try it’s always low points in my assignments 🤧"
My little cousin who is 10(4th grade) has atleast 8 hours of work in the WEEKENDS
"I'm failing so much. I was a honor roll student but now I'm a ""bad kid"" I always get in trouble and get my stuff taken away for the teachers mistakes. I can't believe this.. I wanted to start middle school great but.. its awful"
"I kinda want to go back to school, they just keep pulling up homework and I play a lot of soccer so it’s kinda hard to make time.  I’m mostly looking forward to 3rd trimester, I just need a fresh restart."
"I used to do online school and I was nearly failing every class. now I have straight A""s. but the only reason is because we have smaller class sizes and more class time. only 1 third of students do face to face learning. if we were doing regular school my grades would probably be worse. but with online school it would be way worse. the school system has failed."
"It's almost like the existing education system doesn't work and needs an overhaul... wow, hard to imagine."
"I don't care if everyone at the school bully's me, I just want to go back to normal and in person school. I hate this pandemic so much."
"That’s too bad. Maybe the parents should teach too. And only now the education system is being questioned? LOL"
"I used to be an A student and after online school now I am a C and B student 😭😭😭"
"This year is the most I have failed overall. Yes I’m failing school but also mentally and physically. Somehow staring at a screen all day makes me feel more tired then if I had ran a marathon. Two people from my school have committed suicide this school year and many students from my school have very severe mental problems because of everything going on. Yet they still expect us to be the best generation ever. I wish we could have an uprising lol."
"I have 3 kids who are remote learning right now. They all need individual support and help with the work.  The biggest thing I have a problem with is that the school district here had from March to September to figure out remote learning and they failed to do so. Yes, I am their parent and I'm ultimately responsible for their education but I feel as if the school district has failed us. I work with each of my children individually every single day and they are still struggling with the work because they didn't have the opportunity to finish out the last school year and instead of going over the things they missed, the teachers just started out like any other school year.  We have to remember as adults that these kids are going through something that we never experienced, they are isolated in the home and have little to no interaction with their friends and sometimes family.  Another important part of school they are missing out on is social interaction, it's very important for children to learn how to interact with their peers.  I don't know how other parents are handling the situation but I have been taking it one day at a time."
"I knew someone who skipped three grades and was in the top 10% of the class. During online classes she failed all of her classes and just dropped out."
"At my school we started going to actual school like in 3 months and before that we were all online ofc and mostly all of us were failing online and the teachers and administration knew it.But now they forced to go back online for 3 weeks which will bring my grades to a downfall"
When I was in my old school I was on top a top staright A+ student when i switched to an advanced school 2 years ago I got to a B+ which I expected in the sudden change of difficulty level in studies and now in online school I got my 2021 report card and I literally got C- in almost all academic subjects
"I was a straight A and B student before remote learning. Then immediately when i started remote learning i started failing"
"I’ve been taking 3 online classes per semester since March 2020 and 2 of my classes had live lectures in the Spring 2020 semester, 1 had a live lecture in the Fall 2020 semester, and none have a live lecture this semester."
"I JUST WISH IT'S ONLY ZOOM MEETING WITH NO HOMEWORK"
" parents have to help their children with these online courses. There is  plenty of free programs out there that you don't have to follow the curriculum that your child is receiving within the public school.  There's lots of online classes, you could go back to the way it used to be vocabulary words, 3x each, read g books. Write a story about it, plant some fruit or vegan in containers inside the home or outside,  life skills, such as paying Bill's, laundry, cooking, etc. Current events ,writing about daily  events too. learning stuff on YouTube, great math programs  online, I agree math is the hardest to do online. and finding ways to educate your child through this covid19. It's the child responsibility to do the work yes, but it's the parents responsibility to help your child and guide them through the work. Online schooling isn't for everyone, but while we are at  home doing it, you can order books off at Amazon and send it to the school district!  submit that to get your child school distrisct for there credits so  they can graduate."
"People need to stop using covid as an excuse like im doing online and im chillin like us millenials got mental health but in reality we lazy and think its a joke"
"Before this Bullshit Virus hit I was good with my Grades now I’m not passing"
"Why they just talk about schools, like we college students are failing as well 😭"
"Tbh they just don’t want to watch their kids and most people treat this as a vacation sooo yeah treat it like a vacation you fall behind, it’s not VACATION 😒 only people who need to return is elementary and Exceptional Ed to be hybrid"
"Idk about y’all but remote learning doesn’t have the same vibe as being in school plus I feel like school doesn’t even exist lol😂"
"My child attends a charter school, California Montessori Project.  It really depends upon the teacher.  Many teachers just don’t care, and they pack 40+ kids in one zoom class.  They read to kids Dr Seuss books in junior high.  I understand this is difficult for the teachers, but we really need to do a better job helping our kids."
"Well duh, kids nowadays are on their phones while they’re online “learning”"
"Honestly, online school has been great for me but I have social anxiety and an unpopular opinion on this, I wish things would be normal again for those who are struggling"
"Changing the grade system and giving extra time doesn’t do jack what is learned from the lesson is what matters and non of the lessons are memorable and I’m going to predict right here and now that there will be a spike in failure or low scores in EOC’s and State assignments"
"ive always got straight A's, now im desperately trying to just keep C's"
"Gee, whod'a thunk it?
You can't MAKE them learn under NORMAL circumstances, and the ""educational"" geniuses thought this would work?
 At least it's a fantastic excuse to cover more failure."
"online school sucks so much‼️‼️‼️"
"Yes I’m failing two classes when I’m normally succeeding"
"i’m a sophomore and i’m terrified because i was a straight a student last year and now, idek if i can go to my dream college because of my grades"
"imo online school is fine but its the amount of work they give us thats making me fail"
"The lowering of educational standards so that everyone passes, is now showing it's real impact; many parents are functionally illiterate and cannot help their children with homework.  In college, I saw many other students in class that had trouble understanding the most basic problems and quit because they were way over their heads in the most basic courses.  Now, these people are adults trying to teach their children core school curriculum that they do not understand themselves."
"they just noticed that crazy when i was virtual i was failing all my classes which was in september now semester gon end in 2 weeks passing all my classes with 3 a's 3 b's and 1 c"
"heres in online learning  an idea how about we pass every student
"
"Because people play video games while online class, and they want to focus on class too but the video games are just too attracting. (I play games on class as well, ik the feelings, today, I stopped because I realized that I barely even done anything in a day.)"
"Yahoo says remote learning is a disaster for low-income students.  Income isn't the reason.  Drive, parental involvement and IQ are the main reason a student does worse.  No matter the income."
"Well i imagine it must be tiring sitting in front of a monitor doing work for 7-8 hours everyday, I mean no social life in school or lunch with friends."
"My parents are super mad at me...I failed 3 quarters straight...multiple fs..."
"It effect kids who have accommodation plan because you do better when you in school and when you don’t have constant routine it hard to not have that"
"Student grades are the least important thing we need to worry about right now..."
"Remote learning is child neglect?"
"Bro I failed my first semester of junior year. This sucks. Online school isn't it. I use to have good grades. Rn I'm failing. My mom keeps saying ""Oh u have to do online school"". SHE'S NOT THE ONE WHO WENT THRU A PANDEMIC DURING HER HIGH SCHOOL YEARS!!!"
"I hope I dont get failed this year"
"I think changing the grading system all together is the answer. No failures for missing homework to start with.  Perhaps a 50% is still passing."
"They were already behind before COVID. Not much room to do worse..."
"Bruh everytime i copy and paste my teachers fail me and say why u copy and pasting bruh what u expect me to do just sit their and learn while i could just copy and paste like tf"
"This is a SERIOUS problem. My daughter went from straight As to failing. Something needs to be done. She can't go to school because parents are high risk but online is killing her! They need to lighten the work load and make grades easier."
"Some children living in a bad situation at home so it’s really hard for (some) to work hard at home. But there’s the other kids who don’t have a single problem at home and take that to their advantage, instead of focusing they’re on TikTok, YouTube and other apps."
"expected grades before Lockdown Maths: 9 English: 7 Music: 9 Triple Science: 9 History: 8 Computer Science: 9 Business Studies: 8 Latin: 8 French: 8

"Parents don’t have time to help educate their children at home, but it seems many have plenty of time for school sports, Facebook, affairs with other like-minded cheaters, traveling around the country on vacation or just to be seen in public. All while spreading Covid.
"
"It's not because they're not physically in a school and having remote learning. Nobody seems to take into account the effect that this pandemic and everything that's going on around these children is going on. It's bound to affect their grades and their sense of being and their focus. We're currently in a Time when children have to worry about catching a serious illness just to go to school and learn.  Prayers🙏"
"My report card is comming in this week and I couldn't catch up with my homework.. My Mom would get mad and she would tell my dad who would get mad and wouldnt even let me talk to my friends on my phone for just a minute."
"These are the same SHEEP that protested when some of their governors wanted to open schools up again"
"I'm learning physics from Google.
Better than school teaches me.
Especially online school. It teaches me nothing but stuff you can have with a few Google searches. Even if there's wrong info you can check professionals and trust them, and see different websites to see if they all agree on a fact."
"At this point I haven’t gone to online school for 2 months"
"I can understand grade school children having more of a difficult time and parents needing to be more involved, but high school has no excuse. If you can stay on your pc, Xbox, and PS4/5, for hours on end you can manage school online as well. You communicate fine and can come up with advanced strategies via discord and FaceTime buy can't do school virtually? I would like to see how many of those 40% failing children are Asian. Its about discipline...the material hasn't changed"
"All children are learning no matter the circumstances. I get it ,it doesn't fit the common narrative of school, grades, Graduation. I can tell you from experience my Son thrived taking home school. He was not social so at age 13-18 we pulled him out of brick and mortar School. Plus he needed more sleep and still does. We spent time outside in the Winter learning about shoveling snow, dusting off cars etc.We gardened and cooked together. Besides doing he's on-line classes. He is 26 Now and works at a grocery store and does fine now socially."
"Most students are failing online class at home and their grades are failing behind. I was wondering when is pandemic ends?"
"Thank god I had a normal childhood and education. This generation is going to be the most fucked up of all."
"Remote learning should just be banned. I'm about done."
"To be honest I rather to go to school"
"Parents are at home with kids and too incapable of teaching or even assisting while a teacher does. Parents, failing at their one true job - parenting. Adjust your priorities. I have to home school a 10 and a 12 year old. Its hard but necessary. Imagine you are just working to buy a new big screen TV, or some season tickets to a woke sports team. Maybe that will make it easier for you losers to stay on task and raise your kids to be something other than the grown up adolescents that YOU ARE."
"The public school system isn't the best in normal times. It's designed to produce a populace just educated enough to run the machines, as George Carlin once said. But now they don't even care about that, since those jobs won't be around in the future. Billionaires are making record gains during this lockdown, while we get closer to serfdom ... and serfs don't need to be educated"
"Am so depressed Bc am falling idk what to do any more how do u do math online 😭😭😭"
"Welp, yall could try to lead them into trade school, most of all parents time to shine has failed their own, sad really"
"Ik college can suck with bad teachers, and the current education system, but I just want to be able to skip ahead to a university where I can learn things that will push me to my career. I do enjoy a lot of things I learn in my classes, but so much of it is useless, and even those things I do like to learn , I know deep down are useless :("
"Really??? NOW THEY ARE FAILING?   Could it be the Common Core garbage that the schools were told to teacher for about a decade.  Parents are lost because of the ""new math"" so they can't help their students.  High Schoolers are failing due to distance learning huh could it be that demand put on them from the get go.  The disadvantage children are the ones in special education and those children don't have a saving grace through any of this because the services weren't there before this started. This is why Homeschooling is up in Texas by 400% this year and we aren't even done with the 1st semester yet."
"There are tons of tutorials on YouTube that the students could use for reference. Kids could do everything online except their schoolwork? WTF?"
"“Those already disadvantaged were hit hard, magnifying inequalities for students of color”.  Inequalities in what? Effort, hard work and dedication? This whole social justice equality of outcomes while no equality of effort put it is just plain crazy. You’re telling me white students do better because of an “advantage”?"
"They are failing the kids so the kids keep trying, but in the end, they end up just passing them anyway.  But the problem is they end up driving the parents and kids crazy in the meantime and the poor parents who are ""disdavantanged"", ""poor"", or ""ESL""  feel even more like social outcasts....way to go ""school professionals""  arent you supposed to be a little better at handinling these kinds of things more smoothly like perhaps using token economy better and differentiated instruction??? Yeah blame kids and push it parents..GREAT JOB (SARCASM) Cause even more divorce and arguments among people"
"Good thing I don’t have kids. I could care less about school. 😊😊😊"
"The school system is a joke.. Kids are not protected in school.. Only because it 38 kids to 1 teacher and so many kids fall thru the cracks.. Not because the teacher isnt good.. Its because the teacher has to many students.."
"My step son was a straight A student and now he has Cs ! School has opened and the teachers pay less attention to the online classes they are to busy with the in school students! At times they don’t even have the online class! This kids have no chance this year  maybe they should stop classes altogether until we get this virus under control!"
"They are not learning at home More kids have died from lockdown than from COVID.

"Children can't learn as much on a computer as they can through a classroom. But with this virus are we willing to have them sick or dying?"
"School is a joke
"
"Now the dems care about students education all of a sudden....what a joke."
"Blame the Teachers Unions.  
the 1/2 a$$ programs put out are not online based but classroom based twisted into Zoom meetings. (square pegs into round holes)
children rarely die of Covid.  
u wanted dumb sheep, u got them!
Homeschool ur kids if u can.  find a program w/years of experience & results. 
teach ur kids critical thought"
"School is to stress kids out and make us feel bad about ourselves. We dont do good on a test we beat ourselves up we dont do good on the sat we beat ourselves up. They are teaching us to live the 9 to 5 job life. We sit in classrooms for like 7 hours a day or now in our rooms for 7 hours a day to learn when we wont remember nothing we learnt in years . People go to college for one study and get a job in a different study. They are making us robots. Why dont we learn how to do taxs or buy a house. Instead we learn so math we are never going to use. God bless everyone im times is tuff u will make it through."
"School system is indoctrination camp ANYWAYS! Remove your kids from the school if you can, they are KILLING THEIR FLESH AND SOUL! I can’t believe the world is this dumbed down...."

"Those students must be from low-income families who cannot afford textbooks, have no internet, and without those books they cannot do well in class

"Most parents just want to send their kids back to school because they’re tired to actually have to parent  their kids and a teacher is a free babysitter. 
Boo fucking hoo! 
Never been so happy to still be childless!"
"Online classes is just awful"
"Stop killing kids, and yes this is killing because their lives are ruined and they are hopeless."
"""some school districts are trying to figure out how to help those struggling students by changing the grading system or offering them more time to turn in assignments.""  How about this solution... open schools"
"it's probably still better than the marxist institutions"
"The only story here is kids are not doing their homework, so they are ""falling behind"" and getting failing grades."
"As a former teacher that did the second half of last year during the shutdown teaching, i want to say that yes there are students w special needs that need to be accounted for, but we need to look at a BIGGER issue... the majority of kids and how we are weakening them as a society is the REAL issue (but of couse we blame the system instead). ALL the kids that were failing my online class last spring wouldn't do HALF the assignments if ANY at all. To be honest the assignments I gave were NOT difficult or even time consuming bc i dont believe education has to be complicated or busy work to be effective. The assignments given were simple things that were easier then when I was in high-school like, read a chapter, take a quiz, watch a 10min video. So many wouldn't even do that. It is unethical to pass a student that wont even bother doing work. It just so happened that it was the same students that failed to do any work during the shutdown were the same ones that didnt do homework or spent the majority of the time in class not doing their work during the semester BEFORE covid. These students are the ones that make teaching feel more like babysitting and hold the learning back for everyone else bc we have to cater to their lack of responsibilities. Parents if you feel like it is difficult with one or however many children you have to get them to work try doing that with 90 students at a time. In any given class i taught half wouldn't do their work on time. I had 6 classes w around 30 students per. Sometimes i had to waste half the class period just calling students down individually to ask them where their work is or to talk to them about their failing grades so that we can fix it. Try calling that many parents or writing that many emails each week. At 5min a call that is an extra 7.5h of work on a teacher that they dont get paid for, not to mention the tutorials just to get those kids passing. The issue we are facing isnt one of reforming schools but reforming how we raise children to be more responsible. We have a bunch of lazy, entitled kids today. Dont get me wrong, i loved all my students, even the difficult ones but sometimes i felt like i had to be the parent and teach my students to take pride in being independent and successful. "
"Kids aren’t smart enough to learn on their own. It is all on google and YouTube that teach more than useless teachers..."
"Duh. Keep the school's closed and you get a bunch of kids that have no education. Schools should have never been closed. Now the kids are just shoved into a computer screen or a TV set."
"i did my master's online while working fulltime... those kids need to stop complaining and get w it"
"bahahah only kids falling behind are children with parents to stupid to teach them... sorry kids learn easy if you can't teach them you shouldn't have had them... quit depending on the school to raise your children that's how we got in this mess.."
